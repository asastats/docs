# ASA Stats Tasker code of conduct

Draft 1 - Use [the official discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asastats/comments/rtprj8/asa_stats_tasker_code_of_conduct_discussion/) and [Google Docs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fdvNnKWoHgu9VySbUecIERwVdDCzaFLMZlWZhcLG-xk/edit?usp=sharing) for the update suggestions.


# ASA Stats discussions

Everything in the ASA Stats should be decided upon in a public discussion.

There are three types of discussions in the ASA Stats project:

* DAO discussions

    * Those are the discussions conducted in the [official repository](https://github.com/asastats/dao-discussion/discussions) and they are not related to the internal ASA Stats issues.

* The official discussions

    * The official discussions are the discussions that have a related budget and participation in them in a way that contributes to their outcome will be rewarded. The preferred channel for the official discussions is the [ASA Stats subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/asastats/). A Tasker’s participation in the official discussions (or in any other subproject) has no connection whatsoever with their Tasker role.

* The other discussions

    * Basically everything else in our official channels. The exception to this is the places like #off-topic channel in our Discord for chatting without any benefit to the project, its users, or the community.


# ASA Stats Taskers’ List

Taskers reported bugs and requested features list are hosted in our GitHub:

https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/reported-bugs.md

https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/requested-features.md

Every Tasker should have a GitHub account in order to be able to change the content of those lists.

Every card’s title from our Issue Tracker should get an entry in the list as a list item (with the exception of those cards entitled with [INTERNAL]). List items should be sorted by priority inside their section, with the top priority items on the top.

A checkbox is created by placing `- [ ] ` in front of the item, while the completed task/item is set by placing x instead of space `- [x] `.

# Other conditions for becoming a Tasker

As of Thursday 13, a member who is willing to become a Tasker should open a discussion about it and an existing Tasker or admin (even distribution is suggested) should conduct a verification based on personal preferences. 


# The Process

A Tasker is a member of the ASA Stats community whose duty is to react to community members' requests.

Any community member can react to a request by marking the comment with `:this:`. A comment with enough `:this:` marks becomes a processing obligation for a Tasker.

On Reddit, the official marks like `:this:` are added by enclosing the command name by two colons and two backticks **\`:command:\`**.


## Community member's :this:

The community members mark a comment with `:this:` when they want to see a comment processed by the Taskers and the Team.

If the comment is already `:noted:` by a Tasker then `:this:` becomes optional.

No rewards will be allocated for pointing on a comment with `:this:`.


### Platform-specific instructions for :this:

* Discord

    * Community members marks the comment with :this: emoji
    * The comment's count of :this: emoji has to be at least 5 in order to qualify for processing

* Reddit

    * A community member creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:this:`
    * The other identical comments should be deleted by the commenters or admins
    * The `:this:` comment's count of upvotes has to be at least 10 in order to qualify for processing

* Twitter

    * A community member creates a retweet containing `:this:` and the original tweet
    * Only the first/biggest retweet will be counted
    * The `:this:` tweet's count of retweets and likes has to be at least 20 in order to qualify for processing


## Tasker

A Tasker should first react as a Tasker and afterward as a community member.

A Tasker reaction to a member request should follow the order of the following sections.


### :skip:

A Tasker should always `:skip:` a comment when they don't understand what it is about or when they feel there are Taskers with the better understanding of the topic.

This is the default Tasker reaction. On Reddit and on Twitter it is implied - no need for making a `:skip:` comment on those platforms.


#### Platform-specific instructions for :skip:

* Discord

    * Community members marks the comment with `:skip:` emoji
    * Other Taskers see a comment with `:skip:` just like any other unmarked comment


### :exists:

A Tasker marks a comment with `:exists:` when they are **certain** that the same/similar request has already been issued or if requested functionality is already implemented on website.

The same Tasker or any other community member are encouraged to provide further explanation if such is needed. On the other hand, they are encouraged to ignore (besides `:exists:`) commenters having subsequent `:exists:` comments or who are referring to obviously already existing implementations.


#### Platform-specific instructions for :exists:

* Discord

    * A Tasker marks the comment with `:exists:` emoji
    * A further explanation can be added as a reply to the original comment
    * The other community members can confirm the mark if they want

* Reddit

    * A Tasker creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:exists:`
    * The other identical comments should be deleted by the commenters or admins
    * A further explanation can be added in the same comment next to the starting `:exists:` followed by a space
    * The other community members can upvote the `:exists:` comment if they want

* Twitter

    * A Tasker creates a retweet containing `:exists:` and the original tweet
    * A further explanation can be added in the same tweet next to the starting `:exists:` followed by a space
    * The other community members can retweet and/or like the `:exists:` tweet if they want


### :noted:

A Tasker marks a comment with `:noted:` when they **comprehend** what has been asked for and when they are able to abstract the request into a single title sentence.

Marking a comment with `:noted:` is an obligation for the Tasker to create a card in the ASA Stats Issue Tracker under "Incoming" list.


#### Platform-specific instructions for :noted:

* Discord

    * A Tasker marks the comment with `:noted:` emoji

* Reddit

    * A Tasker creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:noted:`
    * The other identical comments should be deleted by the commenters or admins

* Twitter

    * A Tasker creates a retweet containing `:noted:` and the original tweet


### :na:

A Tasker marks a comment with `:na:` (*not applicable*) when they are sure that the request won't be implemented in ASA Stats.

Marking a comment with `:na:` creates an obligation for the Tasker to further explain the Tasker's/ASA Stats' reasoning for that to the commenter.


#### Platform-specific instructions for :na:

* Discord

    * A Tasker marks the comment with `:na:` emoji
    * The Tasker replies to the original comment with a further explanation

* Reddit

    * A Tasker creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:na:`
    * The other identical comments should be deleted by the commenters or admins
    * A further explanation should be added in the same comment next to the starting `:na:` followed by a space

* Twitter

    * A Tasker creates a retweet containing `:na:` and the original tweet
    * A further explanation can be added in the same tweet next to the starting `:na:` followed by a space


### Issue creation

The Tasker who has marked the comment with `:noted:` has to create a card in our Issue Tracker and assigns him/herself to the card afterward.

The card should be created under the "Incoming" list in the related board. If the request is a priority bug report or update request, then the Tasker should label it that way (red/highest priority).

----------------------- ------------------------------------
**Labels**: Combine priority labels to create more levels: 
                        use High + Yesterday for the highest priority or High + Medium
                        for a level between High and Medium.
                        
----------------------------------------------------------------


### Issue rejection

A related official should check if the issue from the card is already implemented.


#### Already exists

If the card issue happens to have already been implemented on the website, then the official marks the card with "Exists" label, adds the explanation to the card's description field, and moves the card under "Almost done" list.

A Tasker should mark the original comment with `:exists:`, reply to it with the explanation copied/pasted from the card's description, and move the card under the "Archived" list.


#### Not applicable

If the card issue isn't possible to implement or in some other way the request won't be processed, then the official marks the card with "Not Applicable" label, adds the explanation to the card's description field, and moves the card under "Almost done" list.

A Tasker should mark the original comment with `:na:`, reply to it with the explanation copied/pasted from the card's description, and move the card under the "Archived" list.


### Issue acceptance

A related official adds a priority label to the issue card and places it under "Backlog" or "Backlog (dependent)" list as the first/top card.

A related official in this context represents a member of the ASA Stats Team, a developer in a subproject, a researcher assigned for some ongoing engine we’re going to implement in the ASA Stats website, a Tasker, an admin, etc.

The "Backlog (dependent)" list is used when some request depends on some other functionality or effort the ASA Stats hasn’t implemented yet.

A Tasker checks if the card's title has been copied/pasted in the related document ([reported bugs](https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/reported-bugs.md)) or [requested features](https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/requested-features.md)). If that's not the case, the Tasker assigns him/herself to the card and creates an item from the card's title in the related document in the position that reflects the related Issue Tracker board.


### Issue work in progress

An official starts to work on the issue and places the card under the "In progress" list and assigns him/herself to the card afterward.


### Resolved issue

The official who resolved the issue moves the card to "Almost Done".

A Tasker should mark the original comment with `:addressed:`, move the card under the "Done" list, and check-mark the item on GitHub ([reported bugs](https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/reported-bugs.md)) or [requested features](https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/requested-features.md)).


#### Platform-specific instructions for :addressed:

* Discord

    * The Tasker marks the comment with `:addressed:` emoji
    * The Tasker may reply to the original comment with a further explanation

* Reddit

    * The Tasker creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:addressed:`
    * A further explanation may be added in the same comment next to the starting `:addressed:` followed by a space

* Twitter

    * The Tasker creates a retweet containing `:addressed:` and the original tweet
    * A further explanation may be added in the same tweet next to the starting `:addressed:` followed by a space


### Issues evaluation

The cards from the "Done" list are evaluated by the community after every cycle.

A cycle should be set to two weeks and it ends on Friday 23:59 UTC. A community discussion created for the purpose should be opened on the following Saturday and it should outcome with the users’ budget in damo for that cycle.

The cards belonging to the official discussions or to the other subprojects are excluded as they should have their own budgets.


### Commenters' budget and share

The community decides of the shares every original commenter gets.

At the same time or after the previous point, the community decides what is the share of each card in the cycle’s total.


### Taskers' budget

At the same time or after the previous points, the community decides what should be the Taskers budget for the cycle. The influencing factors should be the related users’ budget and the other amount of work done in the cycle, including the Taskers’ work for the subprojects and discussions having their own budgets.


### Taskers' share

Taskers among themselves decide on their individual shares in the cycle’s budget.

If they can’t decide, then they should ask the community to decide for them in a public discussion. No rewards will be provided for such a discussion as such a discussion fails to qualify to be an official discussion. If a community also can’t decide then the Tasker’s cycle budget will be added up to the cycle’s users budget.


### Rewards compiling

A completed cycle list with all the individual shares is sent to the keeper of the Community Rewards Pool.

The keeper checks that all the numbers and the format match. If they don't match then the list is returned back for correction.

The format for the list is the following:

    # this is a comment
    # the next line represents a Discord username
    # and related rewards for the cycle
    username 0.08 damo
    # a minimum amount for now is 0.01 damo (10,000 ASASTATS)
    # so please round the numbers to two decimals in advance
    # the next line represents a Reddit username
    u/username 0.2 damo
    # the next line represents a Twitter handle
    @username 0.05 damo

After the keeper confirms the list is correct, Taskers move the cards from Done to Archived list.


### Usernames public addresses verification

The keeper checks if the usernames are connected with the Algorand addresses

For the missing connections (implies no rewards have been sent yet to that user) an admin from the related channel will reach the user in DM asking for a public Algorand  address.


### Rewards sending

For the missing opt-ins, an admin from the related channel will reach the user in DM asking from them to opt-in for the ASA STats Token.


# Other official discussions and subprojects

Every official discussion or subproject upon finish will get a similar rewards related card under the "Done" list.

The same type of discussions like those for cycle's budgets should take place.

A formatted list having the same format should be sent to the keeper.


# No community rewards will be sent outside of the process


No community rewards will be sent outside of the process defined by this document.
